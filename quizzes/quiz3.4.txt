Theoretically the best page replacement algorithm is,^Optimal algorithm,Least Recently Used(LRU),First In First Out(FIFO),Clock Policy Algorithm
Clock Algorithm outperforms FIFO algorithm in cases where,All pages are equally likely to be referenced,^Certain pages are referenced more often than the others,Some pages are never referenced,None of the above
We can find the page having the longest time to replace by using,Optimal Algorithm,Working Set Strategy Algorithm,^It is not possible to find the time to replacement for a page,None of the above
